					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was about experimenting with functions and callbacks.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I originally tried to create a function that took the square root of a number, but thought I had to import a module to do it so I decided to stick to the example.
						However I forgot that you can raise something to the power of 0.5 to square root it, so now I know better.
