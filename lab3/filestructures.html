			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main idea of this lab was to show us how to create a good file structure on our computer.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Me and my partner had some difficulties communicating over Discord, so we met up in person to complete the lab.
						My partner also lost a few of his files so we had to figure out how to recreate those.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We definitely should have started by meeting in person, it would have made things a lot easier.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too much trouble creating the files - here's my file structure: </p>
